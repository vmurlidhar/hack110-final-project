# hack110-final-project - Which Disney Villain Are You?
Our project is a website that uses a user's input of their favorite songs from different categories to determine which Disney Villain they are from 4 options.

We used functions to take the user's answer choices and count how many of each answer choice was selected, and then figure out which answer choice(1, 2, 3, or 4) was the most selected in order to determine which of the 4 Disney Villains the user was most like.
We used a list in order to store the user's answer choices, and then used a dictionary in order to store the number of times each answer choice was selected.

We learned how to use html formatting and css files in order to format and design a website, and overcame problems such as text not formatting properly on the website (not aligning in the center, not aligning with the answer choices, etc.), or images not appearing because of problems with passing the image's link as a variable.

Team Members:
Varun Murlidhar: worked on CSS and HTML formatting and troubleshooting, and writing functions to process the user's answers
Sadhana Ramesh: worked on compiling questions and answers to ask the user, finding images, and troubleshooting CSS and HTML formatting

Goals Achieved: functioning website that takes in user data/answers to return info (which Disney villain they are)
Goals Outstanding: adding more answer choices and possible Disney Villains that users can get as a result of the quiz
